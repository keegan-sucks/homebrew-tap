  caveats <<~EOS
    Flowstate is ad-hoc signed, so on first launch macOS Gatekeeper will block it.
    Right-click the app and choose Open, or clear the quarantine flag once:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Flowstate.app"

    The soundtrack needs spotify_player authenticated once (Spotify Premium):
      spotify_player authenticate

    Optional: install AeroSpace to auto-place the player terminal on a workspace.
